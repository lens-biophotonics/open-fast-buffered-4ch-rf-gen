# open-fast-buffered-4ch-rf-gen

Here we present an open-source low-cost Arduino-based control system that can store up to millions of commands received
from a computer and then perform reliable high-speed programming of an arbitrary device under its control (DUC) via 
a single or quad-wire Serial Peripheral Interface. The software architecture operates as a real-time state machine, 
making it easily extensible and adaptable to any DUC. Each configuration change can be triggered either externally or 
internally, reaching 1 MHz rates when using a Teensy 4.1 Arduino-compatible board. Leveraging this flexible system, 
we developed a programmable four-channel RF signal generator, based on an Analog Devices 9959 Evaluation board, and 
we demonstrated its capability and validated its performance.
